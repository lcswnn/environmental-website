            Study: The ozone hole is healing, thanks to global reduction of CFCs
          </h3>

          <p>
            This MIT-led study provides the first quantitative proof that the
            Antarctic ozone hole is healing due to global efforts to reduce
            ozone-depleting chemicals. Using a "fingerprinting" technique
            borrowed from climate science, researchers analyzed satellite data
            from 2005 to present and found with 95% statistical confidence that
            ozone recovery is primarily caused by reductions in substances like
            CFCs. Read more by clicking the link below.

            NASA satellites show Antarctica has gained ice despite rising global

          <p>
            This study found that Antarctica actually gained ice from 2021 to
            2023, despite ongoing climate change and global warming. Using NASA
            satellite data spanning over two decades, researchers tracked how
            Antarctica lost substantial ice from 2002-2020 (accelerating from 81
            billion tons lost per year to 157 billion tons), but then gained
            about 119 billion tons per year during 2021-2023. Find out why by
            reading the full article below.

            This clinical trial represents a significant breakthrough in cancer
            immunotherapy, showing that CAR-T cell therapy can be effective
            against solid tumors for the first time. The treatment, called
            satricabtagene autoleucel (satri-cel), was tested on 156 people with
            advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancers who had
            already failed at least two previous treatments. Read the
