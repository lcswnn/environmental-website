            Study: The ozone hole is healing, thanks to global reduction of CFCs
          </h3>

            The article reports on a new MIT-led study confirming that the
            Antarctic ozone layer is healing as a direct result of global
            reductions in ozone-depleting substances. Led by Professor Susan
            Solomon and graduate student Peidong Wang, this research is the
            first to demonstrate with 95% statistical confidence that ozone
            recovery is primarily due to decreased chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
            rather than natural weather variability or greenhouse gases. The
            team used a "fingerprinting" technique borrowed from climate science
            to isolate the specific impact of reduced CFCs, comparing computer
            simulations with satellite observations from 2005 to 2018. This
            success story follows the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which was created
            after Solomon's 1986 expeditions confirmed CFCs were causing the
            ozone hole discovered in 1985. The researchers project that by
            approximately 2035, there might be years with no ozone depletion at
            all, highlighting how coordinated international environmental action
            can effectively solve global problems.
